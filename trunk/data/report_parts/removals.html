      <div style="text-align: justify;">Quality assessment is achieved
as a preliminary step to any microarray analysis. Beforehand, the
scanned array images are visually inspected for artifacts or
mishandling. Illumina beadArrays provide control probes used to compare
arrays within a chip. Diagnostic plots such as density plot, box plot
and a heatmap of between-array distances are used to assess
hybridization quality within the whole data set. Abnormal arrays can be
easily identified by looking at these diagnostic plots.<br>
Note that a given sample can be absent from the final analysis. This is
either because it never made it to hybridization (e.g. bad RNA quality
or not hybridized yet) or as a result of array removal by the data
analyst.<br>
