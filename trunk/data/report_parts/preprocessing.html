Before performing any gene expression comparison, various manipulations
are needed to reduce sources of variation. First, intensities are
adjusted by replacing any value below background by the average
background value over all arrays. Then, all intensities are log2
transformed before being normalized. Filtering allows to remove genes
that are unlikely to carry information about the phenotypes of interest
due to their low overall intensity or variability. This filtering step
will improve the selection of differentially expressed genes with high
statistical significance. Finally, technical replicates may be averaged
to yield the expression values used for the subsequent analysis. <br>
